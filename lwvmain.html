     <h3>Problem</h3>
     <p>In this two week project, our task was to improve an outdated web presence for The League to help with retention and sign up processes. We were limited by several factors, however, in that there was wasn't any alocated budget for their Austin chapter's website and that the Austin chapter was seeing a severe lack of new memberships. Understanding we were meant to solve a digital problem, we also needed to help them with their service design in finding ways to recruit their targeted demographic by improving recruiting strategies..</p>

                Stakeholder Interviews
                </h3>
                <p class="twopar"> We interviewed the leaders of the Austin Chapter in hopes to gain understanding of what they already knew about their web platform and how it could be improved. We also wanted to discover what their passions were and what they felt the league was lacking going forward. This helped us identify several key factors in why this would be come more of a service design project than a digital one.</p>

             We were tasked with creating a better website design for TLWV but we would have to come up with a solution with no current alocated budget. We have bigger fish to fry in that we had some work to do in order to help the leaders of the chapter recruit volunteers and donors so they can improve the budget to implement any design changes.
