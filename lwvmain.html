               When given the project to improve the digital properties of such a storied organization as The League of Women Voters, we believed it to be a very straight forward project. We were quite wrong. It's one thing to take a website and see it needs to be updated and how. We could have taken their current site to people for heuristic evaluation, made changes in colors, menu's and work flows, but we ended up really invested in this project for who they were as people.<br><br>
               <p class="small notsowide">After understanding the problem wasn't so much in interaction design, but in research of their users and how to get them involved, we stopped in our tracks and reevaluated our UX process. As a project I hoped to get more interface work done in the world of HCI, but I really gained empathy for what it's like to holistically help try and solve an entire problem, not just a digital one.</p>
