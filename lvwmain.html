                <p>Our main source of data came in the form of phone interviews. We asked potential users what drove them politically and if they had previous education in politics or voting rules.

Ideas such as Public Booths, partnerships and visiting with students we found were a great way to reach out to potential users</p>

                  <p class="problem">We found coming up with a few solutions to present as options would be best suited for this project. We have designed a responsive website and a native app for future considerations. One of the biggest issues for TLWV is not necessarily the current users, but actively driving targeted users to their platform. We solved this by presenting several ways to do so through community action and education. Our final design was a responsive web presence that's both engaging to the users new and old alike, new and improved features such as calenders and ways to contact local politicians.</p>

                <h2 class="problem">What I learned</h2>
                  <p class="problem">This project was challengeing on many fronts. It was our first group project and we all had different ideas on how to approach it. I learned first and foremost that it's incredibly important to have a defined UX process to use as a guide. When you have a product you think is a good product, then test it. Do not have a dogmatic approach to best practices unless you've tested and the results are there to back it up. Also, TLWV are all volunteer based, so coming up with a product that both fit their brand and would fit within their budget was difficult to comprehend. I learned many things in this project, and it reinforced the need for constant testing and iteration of not only the product, but my own practice of UX strategy</p>
