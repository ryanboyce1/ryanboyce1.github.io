### The Hightower Restaurant

I used The Hightower as my midterm project because I joined their team after deciding to go back to school
after deciding restaurant management wasn't for me. I hope to be able to support them using the skills I learned 
at ACA because they are good people and have been super accomodating to my school schedule and are supportive of me.
